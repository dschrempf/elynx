-- 'Bipartition's are weird in that
-- > Bipartition x y == Bipartition y x
-- is True.
--
-- Also,
-- > Bipartition x y > Bipartition y x
-- is False, even when @x > y@.
--
-- That's why we have to make sure that for
-- > Bipartition x y
-- we always have @x >= y@.

-- and how unrooted trees should be handled.
--
-- Further, branches connected to degree two nodes also induce the same
-- bipartitions and have to be combined.
--
-- For combining branches, a binary function is required. This requirement is
-- encoded in the 'Semigroup' type class constraint (see 'prune').
