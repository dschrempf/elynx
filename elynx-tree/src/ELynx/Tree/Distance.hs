-- Various distance functions for trees.
--
-- The functions provided in this module return distances for __unrooted__
-- trees. See comments of 'symmetric', 'branchScore', and 'bipartitionToBranch',
-- as well as the documentation of
-- [treedist](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/treedist.html).
--
-- It is a little unfortunate that the 'Tree' data type represents rooted trees.
-- However, rooted trees are much easier to handle computationally. In the
-- future, a separate data type for unrooted trees may be introduced, for
-- example, using algebraic graphs. Difficulties may arise because the branches
-- of an unrooted tree are undirected.

-- | Number of incompatible splits.
--
-- Similar to 'symmetric' but all bipartitions induced by multifurcations are
-- considered. For a detailed description of how the distance is calculated, see
-- 'ELynx.Tree.Bipartition.bipartitionCompatible'.
--
-- A multifurcation on a tree may (but not necessarily does) represent missing
-- information about the order of bifurcations. In this case, it is interesting
-- to get a set of compatible bifurcations of the tree. For example, the star tree
--
-- > (A,B,C,D);
--
-- induces the following bipartitions:
--
-- > A|BCD
-- > B|ACD
-- > C|ABD
-- > D|ABC
--
-- However, the tree is additionally compatible with the following hidden
-- bipartitions:
--
-- > AB|CD
-- > AC|BD
-- > AD|BC
--
-- For an explanation of how compatibility of partitions is checked, see
-- 'compatible'. Before using 'compatible', bipartitions are simply converted to
-- partitions with two subsets.
--
-- A bipartition is incompatible with a tree if it is incompatible with all
-- induced multifurcations of the tree.
