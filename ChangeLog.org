* Revision history for ELynx
** Unreleased changes

** Version 0.6.1.1
- Remove plotting functionality (gnuplot incompatible with ghc921).
- Read files strictly.
- Refactor; flatten model hierarchy.

** Version 0.6.1.0
- Split =ELynx.Tools= into separate modules because the package will be reduced.
- Remove the following modules from =ELynx.Tools=: =Concurrent=,
  =LinearAlgebra=, =List=, =Misc=, and =Numeric=.

** Version 0.6.0.0
- elynx-tree :: remove parallel folds with layers (=parBranchFoldMapWithLayer=
  too special and slow).
- elynx-tree :: fix various tree instances; add zip trees with appropriate
  instances.
- Remove =monad-logger= dependency and implement lighter alternative.
- Significant changes to the tool chain.

** Version 0.5.1.0
- elynx-tree :: new functions =isValidPath=, =isLeaf=, =depth=; add conversion
  topology -> tree; various internal algorithmic improvements; improved error
  messages; simplified interface to Newick parsers; parallel fold map; Nix
  flake.
- Remove unneeded dependencies. 

** Version 0.5.0.2
- Speed up mixture model simulation.
- Improve rooting functions.
- Improve =Topology= data type (but still a lot to do).
- Various additions to the documentation.
- Rename =Measurable= to =HasLength=, =Supported= to =HasSupport=, and =Named=
  to =HasLength=.
- Cabal and stack file changes.

** Version 0.5.0.1
- =modLen=, =modSup=.
- Newtype wrappers for branch length, branch support, and node name. Those data
  types and some functions were also renamed.
- Add =Path=, and =getSubTreeUnsafe= to tree zipper.
- Rename =unsafe= functions so that =unsafe= is at the end.
- Many small changes.

** Version 0.4.1
- Improve =TimeSpec= (Point process).
- Parallel evaluation strategies.
- Change names of some functions involving partitions. For example, =mp= was
  renamed to =pt=.
- Improve documentation for (bi)partitions.
- Bugfix =tlynx compare=; do not throw error when branch support values are not
  set.
- Add =no-elynx-file= option.
- Also parse Nexus files with =tlynx= commands.
- Bugfix =subSample=; the sub sample was reversed.

** Version 0.4.0
- Major refactor of =elynx-tree=. All required function can now conveniently
  reexported by =ELynx.Tree=.

** Version 0.3.4
- Improve =slynx examine=; show hamming distance; show constant sites.
- PhyloStrict -> PhyloExplicit; and some conversion functions were changed.
- =tlynx coalesce= was merged into =tlynx simulate=, the syntax has changed; see
  =tlynx simulate --help=.

** Version 0.3.3
- Fix test suites.

** Version 0.3.2
- Remove llvm dependency.
- Move away from hpack.

** Version 0.3.1
- Use Attoparsec.
- Use ByteString consistently.
- Remove elynx-tools dependency from libaries.

** Version 0.3.0
- =elynx-nexus= :: library to import and export Nexus files.
- =elynx-tree= :: major refactor and big cleanup; use rose trees with branch
  labels.
- =elynx-tree= :: provide zippers.

** Version 0.2.2
- Validation and repetition of previous analyses is finally possible with the
  new =elynx= binary.
- A library =elynx-markov= for running Markov processes along phylogenetic trees
  has been split off =elynx-seq=. This library performs the computations when
  executing =slynx simulate ...=.
- Many other small improvements.
