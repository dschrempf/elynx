* The ELynx Suite
Version: 0.7.0.0.
Reproducible evolution made easy.

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/dschrempf/elynx.svg?branch=master"/></p>

A Haskell library and tool set for computational biology. The goal of ELynx is
reproducible research. Evolutionary sequences and phylogenetic trees can be
read, viewed, modified and simulated. The command line with all arguments is
logged consistently, and automatically. Data integrity is verified using SHA256
sums so that validation of past analyses is possible without the need to
recompute the result.

The Elynx Suite consists of library packages and executables providing a range
of sub commands.

The library packages are:
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-nexus][elynx-nexus]] :: Nexus file support.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-markov][elynx-markov]] :: Simulate multi sequence alignments along phylogenetic trees.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-seq][elynx-seq]] :: Handle evolutionary sequences and multi sequence alignments.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-tools][elynx-tools]] :: Tools for the provided executables.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-tree][elynx-tree]] :: Handle phylogenetic trees.

The executables are:
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/slynx][slynx]] :: Analyze, modify, and simulate evolutionary sequences.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tlynx][tlynx]] :: Analyze, modify, and simulate phylogenetic trees.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx][elynx]] :: Validate and redo past analyses.

Documentation is available on [[https://hackage.haskell.org/][Hackage]] (use direct links above).

*ELynx is actively developed. We happily receive comments, ideas, feature
requests, and pull requests!*

* Installation 
ELynx is written in [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]] and can be installed with [[https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-commands.html][cabal-install]] or [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Stack]].

1. Install Stack with your package manager, or directly from the web
   page.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Clone the ELynx repository.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       git clone https://github.com/dschrempf/elynx
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. Navigate to the newly created =elynx= folder and build the binaries.
   This will take a while.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       stack build
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. Run a binary from within the project directory. For example,

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       stack exec tlynx -- --help
   #+END_EXAMPLE

5. If needed, install the binaries.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       stack install
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The binaries are installed into =~/.local/bin/= which has to be added to the
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][PATH]] environment variable. Then, they can be used directly.

Substitution models:
-s "MODEL[PARAMETER,PARAMETER,...]{STATIONARY_DISTRIBUTION}"
   Supported DNA models: JC, F81, HKY, GTR4.
     For example,
       -s HKY[KAPPA]{DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE}
       -s GTR4[e_AC,e_AG,e_AT,e_CG,e_CT,e_GT]{DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE}
          where the 'e_XY' are the exchangeabilities from nucleotide X to Y.
   Supported Protein models: Poisson, Poisson-Custom, LG, LG-Custom, WAG, WAG-Custom, GTR20.
     MODEL-Custom means that only the exchangeabilities of MODEL are used,
     and a custom stationary distribution is provided.
     For example,
       -s LG
       -s LG-Custom{...}
       -s GTR20[e_AR,e_AN,...]{...}
          the 'e_XY' are the exchangeabilities from amino acid X to Y (alphabetical order).
   Notes: The F81 model for DNA is equivalent to the Poisson-Custom for proteins.
          The GTR4 model for DNA is equivalent to the GTR20 for proteins.

Mixture models:
-m "MIXTURE(SUBSTITUTION_MODEL_1,SUBSTITUTION_MODEL_2[PARAMETERS]{STATIONARY_DISTRIBUTION},...)"
   For example,
     -m "MIXTURE(JC,HKY[6.0]{0.3,0.2,0.2,0.3})"
Mixture weights have to be provided with the -w option.

Special mixture models:
-m CXX
   where XX is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60; CXX models, Quang et al., 2008.
-m "EDM(EXCHANGEABILITIES)"
   Arbitrary empirical distribution mixture (EDM) models.
   Stationary distributions have to be provided with the -e or -p option.
   For example,
     LG exchangeabilities with stationary distributions given in FILE.
     -m "EDM(LG-Custom)" -e FILE
     LG exchangeabilities with site profiles (Phylobayes) given in FILES.
     -m "EDM(LG-Custom)" -p FILES
For special mixture models, mixture weights are optional.
